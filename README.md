# Mosaic water image classification project

In this project, the purpose was to study neural networks for water image classification. This is carried out as binary classification case. The data for training consisted of 2 classes - water and other. The water images were created using a simulation environment. The other class images consist real-life images of different objects such as vessels and structures but they were treated as only 1 class.
